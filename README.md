# Stock-Portfolio-Allocation

This project builds an automated pipeline for optimizing stock allocations using modern portfolio theory and machine learning driven insights. The goal is to help users construct portfolios that balance risk and return while staying easy to adapt and experiment with.

Features

Historical data ingestion and preprocessing

Return, volatility, and covariance calculations

Optimization routines using tools like PyPortfolioOpt or custom solvers

Sharpe ratio and efficient frontier analysis

Clear, modular code structure so you can test different strategies

Visualizations to compare portfolio outcomes

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

PyPortfolioOpt or custom optimization code

Matplotlib or Plotly for charts

How It Works

Load and clean historical stock data

Calculate key metrics (returns, covariance, expected risk)

Run the optimizer to generate allocation weights

Compare allocation strategies and visualize results

Export or reuse the optimized weights
